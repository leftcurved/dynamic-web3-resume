# IPFS Integration

## Steps to Upload the Project to IPFS

1. **Install IPFS Desktop or use Pinata**:  
   We used [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) to upload the static HTML files for decentralization. Here are the steps:
   - Create an account on Pinata.
   - Upload the `index.html` file along with any other assets (e.g., CSS, JS files).
   - Pin the files to get a unique CID (Content Identifier).

2. **Link IPFS to ENS**:  
   - After obtaining the CID, link it to your ENS domain using the ENS Manager.

3. **Access the Site**:  
   - The site can be accessed via the CID on IPFS or through your ENS domain.
